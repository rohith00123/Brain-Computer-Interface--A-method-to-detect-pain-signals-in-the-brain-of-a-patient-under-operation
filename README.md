# Brain-Computer Interface-A method to detect pain signals in the brain of a patient under operation
This is a group Project associately done by Rabbi Sudheer Zacharias, DS Sai Rohith, Gaurav Simha.
Patients who are going to go through medical operations are injected with two agents, the paralyzing and the numbing agent. There might be cases where the paralyzing agent is doing its job, but the numbing agent fails to do its part.
Our objective is to construct a system that can convey this problem faced by the patient to the doctors so that further precautionary measures can be taken.
